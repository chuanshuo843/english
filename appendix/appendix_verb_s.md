# Verb+s 规则(三单)
>[!TIP]
>元音字母分别为:[a,e,i,o,u]

## 一般的在单词后加s

```
bird -> birds, mistake -> mistakes, hotel -> hotels
think -> thinks, live -> lives, remember -> remembers
```
## 以[-s|-x|-ch|-sh]结尾
>以s，x，ch，sh结尾的要 + "es"

```
bus -> buses, pass -> passes, address -> addresses
dish -> dishes, wash -> washes, finish -> finishes
watch -> watches, teach -> teaches, sandwich -> sandwiches
```
> 特殊规则(以o结尾的有生命加s,没生命加es)

```
potato -> potatoes, tomato -> tomatoes, do -> does, go -> goes
```
## 以[-f|-fe]结尾
> 以 f,fe 结尾的词，改f为v,再加es

```
shelf -> shelves, knife -> knives, [ roof -> roofs ]
```

## 以[-y]结尾
> 如果y之前的字母发的是元音 直接+S

```
pay -> pays, say -> says
```
>如果y之前的字母发的是辅音音标 则去y加ies

```
study -> studies, try -> tries
```
